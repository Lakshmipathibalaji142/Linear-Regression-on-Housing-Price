# Linear Regression on Housing Price
 This project implements a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. It uses a synthetic housing dataset and includes outlier removal, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The project also features a user-friendly command-line interface to input house details and receive price predictions.  Key Features:  - Data preprocessing with outlier removal and feature scaling - Model training using scikit-learn's pipeline - Evaluation with metrics like MSE and R-squared - Visualization of predictions and residuals - Fuzzy location correction for user inputs
