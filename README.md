Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a comprehensive machine learning workflow using Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. It focuses on linear regression and incorporates string matching using fuzzywuzzy.

Key Components

1. Data Preprocessing
    - Utilizes pandas for data manipulation and cleaning
    - Implements ColumnTransformer and Pipeline for scaling and encoding features
2. Model Building
    - Constructs a linear regression model using scikit-learn
    - Handles dataset splitting into training and testing sets
3. Model Evaluation
    - Measures performance using Mean Squared Error and R-squared
    - Visualizes results using matplotlib and seaborn
4. Fuzzy Matching
    - Applies fuzzywuzzy for string matching

Dependencies

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- fuzzywuzzy

How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequence

Future Improvements

- Add markdown cells to explain code blocks
- Include additional models for comparison
- Expand on fuzzy matching with more use cases
